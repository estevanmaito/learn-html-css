# Learn HTML & CSS

This is a WIP translation of my book [Aprenda HTML & CSS](https://github.com/estevanmaito/aprenda-html-css) (in Portuguese).

It was written in 2016 and contains everything a complete beginner needs to learn HTML & CSS and create an entire landing page by the end of the book.

You may ask yourself: "How can a book from 2016 help me succeed in 2021?". And you may be surprised, but back then that book already had the bleeding edge properties from both technologies, the only thing that I'm going to add, that wasn't present back then, are chapters talking about CSS Grid.

This book was paid and more than 700 people have bought it, but since 2019 I decided to make it free, so enjoy.

## Chapters

This book is divided into very small chapters, around 1 - 1 1/2 pages. Things are not as complicated as you may be thinking and dividing it into digestible pieces, you can always come back to exact place you need and also keep progressing even if you don't have much time.
